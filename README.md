# Tests: Lines & pagagraphs
Create interactive tests here for language enablement, gap analyis, exploration, etc. relating to the [Lines & paragraphs](https://w3c.github.io/typography/#blocks_paragraphs) section of the Language Enablement Index.

This repository is where interactive tests can be stored and their results described.  Create one issue per test and apply the relevant labels to allow for filtering, sorting and export to a test summary page.
